## Installation

- First of all back up your `~/.config/nvim` and delete the original and then run: `git clone https://github.com/mohammad-amin-khajeh/lazyvim ~/.config/nvim`
- back up `~/.local/share/nvim` and `~/.local/state/nvim` just in case.
- Lastly, enter neovim and voila:)

## Why? Especially when you have a working nvchad config

With nvchad I just found myself on a constant ***Configuration treadmill***.
That is, configuring more than getting actual job done.
With lazyvim I'm hoping to alleviate this issue.
Especially considering that lazyvim is more like an actual neovim distribution and not just a starter config.
